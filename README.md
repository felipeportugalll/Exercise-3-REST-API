# Salesforce DX Project: REST API - Weather

Use Case
As a call center nurse of the UK healthcare company, I need to check weather conditions in order to be able to have a full overview of any possible impact on the patient's health and be able to provide directions.

Requirements
Create a Lightning Web Component that will be integrated into the Account layout
Invoke openweathermap API in order to get the weather of the associated city (https://openweathermap.org/current )
Display
Temperature
Description
Icon (https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions )
Hint: For deserialization, you can create a wrapper that will have the same structure as a response instead of parse it.
